# Using Rose-Studio's Meta-Programming Features

_Asuman Suenbuel (c) 2019_

This 'connection scenario class' is created for documentation purposes to illustrate and explain the use of the meta-programming features available when working with Rose-Studio. This is a 'live' document that is part of the Github code that is associated with this class; you can find it's content in the toplevel README.md file. If you are reading this as part as part of the "Settings" tab, then you are seeing one Rose-Studio feature in action: if there is a README.md file on the toplevel of the file hierarchy, it will be display here formatted using a markdown processor.
