# Scenario description

This is the description of the example scenario.


Initial overview of the scenario. The general purpose of the demo was to have hands-on experience with the 1:1 integration and related challenges concerning collaborative robots from different vendors when working together. The intention of the following demo was to show how robots <-> robots and robots <-> humans can work together. This is not a working integration â€“ more a rapid prototype. The following displayed service is also not ROS, but a service for demo purposes only.
