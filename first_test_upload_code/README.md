## Robotic Simulation Scenario (Demo)

This scenario defines variations of a simulated environment where robots move between tables and do logistics tasks.

### Prerequisites

You need a Linux PC running ROS and have `fetch_gazebo` package (optionally `mir_gazebo` package) installed. A working VMWare image for ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04 can be found [here](https://www.mathworks.com/supportfiles/robotics/ros/virtual_machines/v3/installation_instructions.htm); check the "archive" link in the Linux 64-bit section. A fetch-gazebo tutorial can be found on the [fetchrobotics.com website](http://docs.fetchrobotics.com/gazebo.html)
